Usage examples for byte-genie API.

Examples are categorised by use-cases, including company research, question-answering on data, model training/fine-tuning, etc.

To run these examples, you will need a ByteGenie API key. You can create an api key by creating an account on [ESGnie]([https://link-url-here.org](https://app.esgnie.com)https://app.esgnie.com).

Once you have an API key, save it in a secrets.json file inside the code repo, along with your username. Some examples may require an OpenAI API key as well, which can also be set in secrets.json. Here is an example of secrets.json 
{
    "username": "...",
    "BYTE_GENIE_KEY": "...",
    "OPENAI_KEY": "..."
}

Once secrets.json is setup, you can run any of the python scripts or jupyter notebooks to get started.
