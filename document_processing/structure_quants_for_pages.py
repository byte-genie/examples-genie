As we can see, the structured quants data contains a structured dataset of extracted quants, as well as a `relevant quote from text` column, and a `context` column.  
`context` column contains the details of the page, from which the data was extracted, and 
`relevant quote from text` column contains the most relevant part of the context relevant to the extract value in that row.

We can see that a context has different sections, like `## tablenum-0`, `## tablenum-1`, `## text-segments`, etc. 
These sections correspond to different parts of the page, from which the data was extracted. 
For example, `## tablenum-0` corresponds to the first table on the page, 
`## tablenum-1` corresponds to the second table on the page, 
and `## text-segments` corresponds to the remaining text segments (passages) on the page.
